#strings are immutable in python
#they cannot be changed using replace function
#replace creates an entirely new string
#it doesn't modifies the original existing string

example:
name = "shivendra is a good good boy"

print(name.replace("good","bad"))
print(name)

name will remain same and print out as it is
