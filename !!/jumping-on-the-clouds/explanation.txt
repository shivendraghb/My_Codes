there are a number of clouds c_count and the player always starts from
the first cloud (0th index). Initially the energy is energy=100 for each
jump the player consumes 1 unit energy.
The clouds in the array with value 1 are thunderclouds and the clouds with
value 0 in the array are cumulus clouds if the player lands on a
thundercloud then there will be extra penalty of 2 energy points.
Calculate the number of remaining energy points wiht the player when the
player returns back to the first (0th index) cloud.

input: c_count -> the number of clouds in the array
       k -> the jump count
       c[] -> the array of clouds
Initially the energy is 100.
output: the energy remaining at the end of complete circular travel.

sample input: 8 2
              0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0

sample output: 92
