here a cipher text was given:

“cbmexqigz tif hbnolso djtvdskr bfuyhjv tifku bjocud rfqthxmaoiwtcmf”.
The hint: an image of fibonacci spiral.
          You should start from 0 everytime.

so to decode the cipher text:
>> if we use fibonacci sequence starting from 0 (as given in hint) to manipulate
the cipher text, we will have to shift back the alphabets of the words
in cipher text by the number that the crresponding letter of the cipher
letter falls on the fibonacii series.

>> fibonacci series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21......

>> if we do so for first word "cbmexqigz"
c -> 0 -> c-0=c
b -> 1 -> b-1=a
m -> 1 -> m-1=l
e -> 2 -> e-2=c
x -> 3 -> x-3=u
q -> 5 -> q-5=l
i -> 8 -> i-8=a
g -> 13 -> g-13=t
z -> 21 -> z-21=e
>> the word comes out to be: CALCULATE
similarly doing this for rest of the cipher word we get:

>> "CALCULATE THE HAMMING DISTANCE BETWEEN THEIR BINARY REPRESENTATIONS"
    voila!!!! wow!

>> the code does the rest of the work.

>> we can calculate the xor result of the two numbers.
>> by doing so we can get to know where the numbers differ in their
>> binary representations, where there will be 1 in the xor result it means
>> they had difference there in their binary representations
>> the while loops checks the same
>> we increment the value of distance every time we get the rightmost
>> digit of xor result equal to 1.
>> then we rightshift the xor result by 1 so that it is checked with
>> every digit of the xor result.

>> return digit.
