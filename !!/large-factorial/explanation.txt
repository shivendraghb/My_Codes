here a void function was given to complete which takes argument
the input number n.
the key logic was that factorial of numbers greater than 20 cant't
be stored in C/C++ even for 64-bit type.
therefore the solution was to store the digits in a array and then
print the result.

the nested for loops does the same.
the concept of carry was used to ensure that the factorial is stored in
the correct sequence of digits and it is calculated properly.
we can't simply use the logic of factorial code as when the numbers get
large we will face the same issue.

the while(carry) loop increases the size of array until there is any
number(carry) left to add in the array.

but the numbers are stored in reverse order(eg. 5!={0,2,1})
the other for loop is used to print the numbers in the array in the
correct order.
